## Instructions

- [ ] Fork this repository and clone it to your `critical-web-design` folder on your machine.
- [ ] Design
	- [ ] Select an example from [Swissted](https://www.swissted.com/) or [search for one](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swiss+design+examples&iax=images&ia=images) that speaks to you
	- [ ] Open `designs/1.psd` in Gimp or Photoshop
	- [ ] Using **only the Type and Shape tools**, recreate the design you chose
	- [ ] Your layout should fit within the Bootstrap grid layout.
	- [ ] Save your document often
	- [ ] Make new versions as needed, naming them `2.psd`, `3.psd`, etc.
- [ ] HTML/CSS
	- [ ] Using only HTML and CSS code your design inside `index.html`
	- [ ] Do not add image files to the code. Retype the text from the example you chose
	- [ ] Use the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) as well as custom CSS to create your design
	- [ ] Use CSS `position`, `border`, and `translate()` properties to create and rotate lines
	- [ ] Include a link to the image of the original design at the bottom of the page.
- [ ] Save and test your work, and commit and push changes regularly
- [ ] Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Note: Only *your* CSS files because Bootstrap's built-in support for older browsers [will not validate](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/))
- [ ] When finished, [publish and post your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit#bookmark=id.8jryplv1i8a)
